# DECISIONS

Settled calls. Do not relitigate. Changing anything here is **Tier 2** — live,
Vishnu present (`POLICY.md`).

These are Vishnu's decisions, recorded as given on 2026-09-03/05. They are not
findings and are not "verified" in the evidence sense — a decision is true because
it was decided. Where a decision *references* a system fact, that fact is checked
and the evidence noted inline.

## 2026-09-03 / 2026-09-05 — monitoring & triage loop

### Channel and escalation

- **D1. Slack is the channel.** Routine output goes to Slack.
- **D2. No auto-action on silence.** Absence of a signal never triggers an action.
  Silence is reported, not acted on. (Restated as a standing rule in `POLICY.md`.)
- **D3. P0 escalates by SMS every 15 minutes** until acknowledged.
- **D4. claude.ai is the call path**, plus a daily digest delivered via Gmail.

### Cost

- **D5. $100 API cap. $50 alert threshold.**

### Models

- **D6. Opus 5 for alarms. Sonnet 5 for digests.**

### Cadence

- **D7. 08:00 PT daily. Monday's run also carries the weekly.**

### Scope of v1

- **D8. Mode is maintenance** — not feature development.
- **D9. v1 = 5 signals + the customer signal**, triage by cron or manual
  invocation, **IDs only** in output.
- **D10. Data leaving the DB toward a model or Slack is IDs, badges, and counts
  only.** No names, no emails, no coordinates, no token values. (Mirrors the
  standing rule in `POLICY.md`.)

### Site-specific

- **D11. Bethel AME Church `53c71c64` has enforcement off and is excluded from
  ping signals.**
  Evidence checked 2026-09-05: site id `53c71c64-1973-4f82-be9c-98e4800beece`,
  name `Bethel AME Church`, tenant `STARNET SECURITY`
  (`27c4d404-8769-49ca-bfd6-93cb9b890067`), `checkpoints_enabled = false`,
  `is_active = true`, `timezone = America/Los_Angeles`. The `checkpoints_enabled`
  flag confirms enforcement is off at the site level. **The ping-signal exclusion
  is a decision about the monitoring loop, not a DB flag — there is nothing in the
  schema to check it against.** It must be implemented in Phase 2 and cannot be
  inferred from site state.

## How to add to this file

One dated section per decision batch. State the decision, then — if it references
a system fact — the evidence and the date it was checked. A decision whose
supporting fact has since changed is still a decision; note the drift rather than
silently editing the decision.
